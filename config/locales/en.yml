      simply_rails: "Ruby on Rails, or simply Rails, is a server-side web
        application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a
        model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a
        database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use
        of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer, and HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript for display and user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails
        emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and
        paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself
        (DRY), and the active record pattern."
